## Stakeholders

Our users are college students searching for internships. We interviewed college students - not direct friends.

Our stakeholders are anxious and classify themselves as overthinkers. They do not like how formal current platforms are. 

## Product Vision Statement

We aim to create a user-friendly app that facilitates professional networking between students and companies for a less stressful internship search.

## User Requirements
1. `As a new user, I want to provide necessary information like a username, email, and password so that I can create a new account.`
2. `As a new user, I want to sign up using my existing Google account so that I don't have to keep track of another account.`
3. `As a new user, I want a verification email to be sent to the address I provided so that I can ensure the security of my account.`
4. `As a new user, I want to provide information such as my resume, educational information, work experience, skills, and career interests so that I can be matched to jobs that I find interesting and that I meet most of the qualifications for.`
5. `As a new user, I want to have the option of my resume being parsed so I don't have to spend more time manually entering all the information.`
6. `As a new user, I want to be guided through a brief platform tutorial so that I can discover the highlights of this application and how it can help me with my job search.`
7. `As a user, I want to be able to edit my job preferences, skills, and work experience so that it accurately reflects my skill set and career interests at all times.`
8. `As a user, I want to receive mobile notifications so that I can get relevant application updates and reminders of upcoming deadlines whenever I'm on the go.`
9. `As a user, I want to be able to look up specific roles so that I can find the closest match to positions I would look forward to applying to.`
10. `As a user, I want to be able to consult the description, location, pay, company name, and qualifications of each role so that I can decide whether this internship is a good fit for me.`
11. `As a user, I want to be redirected to apply to the positions I am interested in through an "apply" button so that I can start submitting applications to these roles.`
12. `As a user, I want the platform to mark when I applied to a position so that I can track my progress and avoid submitting multiple applications to the same role.`
13. `As a user, I want to access a dashboard that tracks all my applications so that I can keep track of the total number of applications submitted, what the names of these roles are, at what company, and how far along I am in each process.`
14. `As a user, I want to write cold emails for roles I am interested in using AI so that I can receive support as I attempt to expand my network, helping my internship application journey and my confidence as an applicant.`
